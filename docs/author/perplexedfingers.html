                <p>It takes three people and four years to persuade me to write something. I hope the motivation can
be kept up for some time.</p>
<p>I don't have any job that can pay the bill now. I hope writing something can help stabilizing my
emotion, and see if I can come up more scribble or side-projects. But maybe I should not count on
anything that soon just yet.</p>
<p>I am still not sure about <cite>nmnlist</cite> theme. I just could not find a dark theme, but the layout seems
to be not very intuitive to me. Maybe I would create one myself some day.</p>
<p>I will put some notes from class I take these days if I still have time and energy. I will be
writing in English or Traditional Chinese.</p>
